A simple thread safe logging class.

The class is defined in a single header file and a single source file.

             'stone.hh' and 'stone.cc'


Use with the following three macros INFO, WARN and ERROR.  If the macro __LOG__
is defined before the header is included the logging output is written to
a file.  Default is 'log.out'.  But this can be changed with the static function
'log::file( const char* new_file_name )'.

One limitation of this class is that logging can not be turned off project wide.
