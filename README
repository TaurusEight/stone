A simple thread safe logging class.

The class is defined in a single header file and a single source file.

             'stone.hh' and 'stone.cc'


Use
---
Use with the following three macros INFO, WARN and ERROR.  If the macro __LOG__
is defined before the header is included the logging output is written to
a file.  Default is 'log.out'.  But this can be changed with the static function
'log::file( const char* new_file_name )'.

Improvements
------------
Tweaking the macros would allow for logging to std::cerr rather than a file.
A nice feature would be to allow several files for logging rather than one.
